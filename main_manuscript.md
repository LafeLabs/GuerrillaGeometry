# Action Geometry

## Introduction: 

concept and philosophy, images of finished products, explanation of why i'm doing this and why you should do it too, where it's all going, self replication.

## First Construction C1

1. First show the final products and required tools
2. create equilateral triangle with compass and ruler 3 inches, 
3. 8 cm, 
4. repeat with a drink lid and straight edge and finger, 
5.  color in with crayons, 
6.  color in with colored pencils and 
7.  color in with markers, 
8.  cut out, laminate, 
9.  cut out paste to cardboard
10.  use existing triangle to make more triangles, make more, show how they tile
11.  apply 2x transformation both going up and down in size, cut out and laminate
12.  use to build a hexagon and David Star
13.  label, document, spread into environment and observe and communicate
14.  repeat all these steps with a square
15.  construct Golden Rectangle from square, then pentagon, both small and large, show Golden Ratio and Golden Spiral
16.  Penrose tiles, construct, make tilings, attempt to spread

## Second Construction C2

0. start with products and tools, cereal boxes or equivalent 
1. tetrahedron
2. cube
3. octahedron
4. icosahedron
5. dodecahedron
6. concept of the dual, relations between duals
7. The tetrahedron/octahedron lattice, relation to solid state physics and rocks, structural elements, "space frame"

## Third Construction C3

0. materials and final products, motivation, why alchemy
1. art box, 6 inch cardboard octahedron
2. octahedron/tetrahedron system from sticks, AIR, with empty space, show how to make lattices, larger structures, this is BCC, Cesium chloride, 
3. HDPE and aluminum and LED tetrahedron with AA batteries? 3 inch, FIRE, with red paint
4. suspended plant cubes showing how to make a lattice of them, EARTH in the cube
5. icosahedron, WATER element, using pentagon and holes drilled in plastic and styrofoam or bottles with 5 fold symmetry or hub caps with 5 fold symmetry, show how they can go together to form a 3 foot stick tetrahedron suspending the 1 foot stick octahedron and the plant cubes, show renderings of icosahedron underwater for large scale rotating aquaculture, with manipulation of relative bouyancy of unit cells
6. dodecahedron chemical cell to drive LED in tetrahedron, which goes on top of dodecahedron to make a night light, ION and FIRE, so ALL FIVE ELEMENTS have been built


## Fourth Construction C4

0. Conic sections, discussion, history, applications, finished products, tools
1. ellipse: circles, string and pen construction, rope and chalk construction, flashlight and compass combined with other methods, various trammel constructions
2. parabola: arcs, flashlights, construction with rulers, compare them all, discuss asteroids vs. comets with practical examples
3. solar blaster, build and use it
4. solar blaster applications and deployment and safety

## Fifth Construction C5

0. motivation and tools
1. fractal dymaxion
