# Action Geometry

## Introduction: 

concept and philosophy, images of finished products, explanation of why i'm doing this and why you should do it too, where it's all going, self replication.

## First Construction C1

1. First show the final products and required tools
2. create equilateral triangle with compass and ruler 3 inches, 
3. 8 cm, 
4. repeat with a drink lid and straight edge and finger, 
5.  color in with crayons, 
6.  color in with colored pencils and 
7.  color in with markers, 
8.  cut out, laminate, 
9.  cut out paste to cardboard
10.  use existing triangle to make more triangles, make more, show how they tile
11.  apply 2x transformation both going up and down in size, cut out and laminate
12.  use to build a hexagon and David Star
13.  label, document, spread into environment and observe and communicate
14.  repeat all these steps with a square
15.  construct Golden Rectangle from square, then pentagon, both small and large, show Golden Ratio and Golden Spiral
16.  Penrose tiles, construct, make tilings, attempt to spread

## Second Construction C2

0. start with products and tools, cereal boxes or equivalent 
1. tetrahedron
2. cube
3. octahedron
4. icosahedron
5. dodecahedron
6. concept of the dual, relations between duals
7. The tetrahedron/octahedron lattice, relation to solid state physics and rocks, structural elements, "space frame"
