We begin with a point.    
We then draw a second point, anywhere, a reasonable distance away, and connect the two with a line.
Then draw a circle around another point.
Then draw a line through the center and mark the intersection.
Complete the vesica pisces with a second circle centered on the edge of the first.
Mark where the circles meet with a point. 
Connect the points to make the triangle, draw circle around third point.
