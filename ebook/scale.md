# Scale and units

### top down distance 

What scale do we care about for this work?  My goal in building a practical geometry is always to be concerned with addressing human needs through technology.  The largest distance scale that is relevant is that of the Solar System, since it determines seasons, weather, and is useful for navigation.  The stars are also useful for navigation, but for our purposes here, they can be considered to be points so far away that I don't care exactly how far away.  

So the largest unit to use is the astronomical unit, or AU, which is the distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun.  

1 parsec (3.26 ly)


put it all in a huge table and also a simplified table with diagrams for all
size of universe, compare to Archimedes result
1 LY  (32 million light seconds)
1 AU (500 light seconds)
find how far away a star is.  Do I care? no.  But it's amusing.  Summarize results.

earth-moon distance(1.25 light seconds)

tides, phases of moon

1 light second(1 billion feet)
circumference of Earth(40,000 km)
nautical mile(1.14 statutory miles)
relate nautical mile and km using earth, angles, how to measure circumference, how the greeks did it and how the French did it for the SI
statutory mile(5280 feet)
km (1000 m)
football field(100 m or 100 yards)
fathom(2 yards, 6 feet)
meter(100 cm)
yard(3 feet)
cubit(18 inches)
foot(12 inches)
sexicubit(3 inches)
inch(2.54 cm)
cm(10 mm)
mm(1000 microns)
mil(25.4 microns)
micron(1000 nm)
nm(10 angstrom)
angstrom


compare all these to:

 - sticks
 - paper thickness
 - pen thickness
 - pencil thickness, before and after sharpening
 - wavelength of visible light
 - atoms
 - skin cell
 - onion cell
 - E coli
 - DNA double helix
 - printer panels
 - duct tape thickness
 - HDPE sheet thickness
 - height of typical high-rises, relation to local geography

## SI, the "metric system", and the French Revolution

## Anarchist cubit



## angles

radians, degrees, circles, sin(theta) = theta for small angles etc. 

my trig table, my whole system of trigonometry and calculus based on angles and triangles

## Precision vs. accuracy etc.

Nothing in my system of knowledge involves precision greater than about 1%.  Not time, not distance, not mass, not magnetic field, not angle, nothing.  In some cases it will appear we care about more than 1% but that's usually because we're using the wrong units.  For instance, I often care about temperature to within 1 degree F, which is less than 1% of 300k.  But kelvin are simply the wrong units for indoor temperature control.  The range should be 50 F to 80 F at the absolute outside, so 1 F is only a few percent relative to a reasonable zero point and scale.  

Floating point is a capitalist conspiracy.  You only need it when you are too lazy to do your geometry right.  We can re-write trigonometry with 2 digits only, re-write calculus with no infinities and only 1% precision, all based on triangles from the 2 digit trig tables.  e, pi, phi, --all these are just 2 digits maximum now.  pi = 3.1, e = 2.7, phi =  1.6, sqrt(2) = 1.4, sqrt(3) = 1.7, k = 1.4e-23 J/k, c = 3e8 m/s, 

Also for units, a goal is to always find good normalizations, which relate up and down in scale
