# Scale and units

### top down distance 

What scale do we care about for this work?  My goal in building a practical geometry is always to be concerned with addressing human needs through technology.  The largest distance scale that is relevant is that of the Solar System, since it determines seasons, weather, and is useful for navigation.  The stars are also useful for navigation, but for our purposes here, they can be considered to be points so far away that I don't care exactly how far away.  

So the largest unit to use is the astronomical unit, or AU, which is the distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun.  

1 parsec (3.26 ly)


put it all in a huge table and also a simplified table with diagrams for all
size of universe, compare to Archimedes result
1 LY  (32 million light seconds)
1 AU (500 light seconds)
find how far away a star is.  Do I care? no.  But it's amusing.  Summarize results.

earth-moon distance(1.25 light seconds)

tides, phases of moon

1 light second(1 billion feet)
circumference of Earth(40,000 km)
nautical mile(1.14 statutory miles)
relate nautical mile and km using earth, angles, how to measure circumference, how the greeks did it and how the French did it for the SI
statutory mile(5280 feet)
km (1000 m)
football field(100 m or 100 yards)
fathom(2 yards, 6 feet)
meter(100 cm)
yard(3 feet)
cubit(18 inches)
foot(12 inches)
sexicubit(3 inches)
inch(2.54 cm)
cm(10 mm)
mm(1000 microns)
mil(25.4 microns)
micron(1000 nm)
nm(10 angstrom)
angstrom


compare all these to:

 - sticks
 - paper thickness
 - pen thickness
 - pencil thickness, before and after sharpening
 - wavelength of visible light
 - atoms
 - skin cell
 - onion cell
 - E coli
 - DNA double helix
 - printer panels
 - duct tape thickness
 - HDPE sheet thickness
 - height of typical high-rises, relation to local geography

## SI, the "metric system", and the French Revolution

## angles

radians, degrees, circles, sin(theta) = theta for small angles etc.
