# Symmetries

In school we're taught that numbers are just numbers, all the same.  4 is just 3 plus one and 5 minus 1.  Sure it has lot's of special properties involving numbers like being a perfect square, but those things are also just lists in an endless series of number-based facts that students are forced to memorize.  If you ask someone many years after finishing school about various numerical facts, they have probably forgotten.  But ask the same person to draw a picture with 2 fold or 3 fold symmetry and they'll have no problem drawing a square or a roughly equilateral triangle.  This is because geometry simply interfaces better between the physical world and the mind than numbers.  Numbers make a lot of sense to some people and not much sense to others.  The basic concepts of shape might or might not be "obvious" to all, but they can be learned in a hands-on language-independent way

# Special Triangles

## magic angle = 54.7 degrees = arctan(sqrt(2))

Methane, CH4 has bond angle of twice the magic angle, about 109.47 degrees.  Also magic angles matter in NMR and it affects some artifacts in MRI.
