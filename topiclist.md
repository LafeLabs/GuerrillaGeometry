Title: Adventure Geometry


I think this is looking like the following books:

- Manifesto(done, free pdf and cheap print copy)
Guerrilla Geometry(hand copied, taught orally, distributed physically with structures, also youtube vids and pdf for backup)
- Ion Magic(Electronics and Electromagnetism, back to pdf format with detailed design files for all the electronics, this is both measurement and fabrication in fluids, high voltage work , coils and magnets, E&M from artistic perspective without numeric bullshit)
- creek, tides, waves and wind machines.  this will be based on extensive time camping on the water around sticks and studying historical mine technology texts
- fluctuations and noise and oscillations:  mechanical and electrical
- Memoir of a Trash Wizard, autobiography
- Physical interfaces with living systems using the above techniques


So all the musical instrument bullshit and the ion transport measurement bullshit and the noise bullshit and the creek bullshit and biology bullshit goes later.  And now I must focus on the elements of a new geometry.

Each thing in the book is a physical construction which self replicates with help from people.  Construction sets are meant to be  self contained with documentation and the physical thing.  Copies of book should correspond to copies of all geometric constructions.  All constructions should be able to scale up or down as more participants add to them.  

Some of these elements are:

- plane geometric art using compass and straightedge and colored pencils
- three dimensional fabrication using cardboard based on 2d geometry
- three dimensional fabrication with plastic, welding with a candle and pliers
- three dimensional fabrication with sticks
- physical construction and use of logarithms
- conic sections and light: parabola, hyperbola, ellipse, construct solar concentrator using parabolic triangle technology and reflectors and a suspended stone crucible, parabola of a projectile compared to projection
- geometric optics: lenses and gratings, diffraction, all as art project, use of tiny ball lenses from trash
- geometry carved in stone
- studies in surface roughness and interaction with fluids flowing along - surfaces:plastic, wood, stone, grinding and polishing, also motion of grains of sand and other particles of all sizes on roughnesses of all levels, studies of stiction
- rope and stake geometry, laying out huge patterns on a field, then going up high to look down at it
- three dimensional rope and stake geometry for relating hiding  places in a complex urban environment
- tensegrity study with sticks
- using buildings in urban skyline to do geometry/geography to navigate in a city, triangle lattices around, build unique coordinate set, integrate with rope and stake geometry
- kite construction using triangles
- flash mob structure construction and destruction using various triangles
- fractal study of our direct physical environment, try to connect all scales from 1 angstrom to 1 meter using some type of geometric connection
- geometric fluid studies using artistic concepts, both liquid and gas, study vortex geometry the old fashioned way, study the old work from the late 1800s
- religious architecture of all denominations and geometry, study of local buildings
- A study of the concept of the tangent line, real vs. make believe
- geometric study of the pendulum, use to build a time base, create patterns from swinging rocks and some form of ink


All the work on electric and magnetic fields gets pushed off to the E&M book.  All the work on plastic and wood and stone machines driven by water goes to the book on creek tech.  Various motors and vibrators get pushed to the oscillations and fluctuations book.   Any serious creek work is pushed to that as well.  Studies of the creek will be all about moving rocks and observing and drawing.  This is about understanding the creek as a mathematical system to set up actually using it in later volumes.




Constructions(chapters are all called constructions):

1. Colored circle: pentagon and hexagon and subsets 
2. Tilings.  Penrose and triangle, cardboard and paper, paint and colored pencil, self replicating, 2d and 3d but all based on same core
3. Logarithmic spiral construction, log of the log of the log, sticks with logs logs with sticks
4. tetrahedral geometry with sticks which grows and changes, rope and rocks, plastic bags, structures of all kinds based on stick tetrahedra with gravity and rope and sticks for fasteners
5. Pendulum geometry without drive, rocks on ropes on sticks
6. pendulum geometry driven by flowing water, observe the fluctuations, find geometry of periods and chaos, create attractors for both chaotic and not chaotic solutions
7. two dimensional wave solutions with rocks and rope and sticks and water drive
8. magnetic field geometry
9. electric field geometry
10. vortex filament geometry, vortices in general
11. dissipation geometry
12. concept of tangent and derivative from geometric perspective 
13. fluctuations and noise
14. resonance
15. impedance, dissipation and noise
16. negative differential resistance, oscillators from dc, electrical and mechanical and both this is where we diverge from the digital computers and microfab chips and start using nonlinear slime blobs for all computing by having nonlinear elements that can show negative differential resistance


each page self replicates, is part of a greater whole and evolves, is physical, no more computers.


Subjects of Applied Guerrilla Geometry:

- two dimensional constructions with compass and straight edge
- sacred geometry history and culture and art construction of logarithms from geometry, applications, construction of numerical  graphical solutions to basic equations like resonator frequency using color codes in art and log log image plots by hand
- structural geometry with sticks, tensegrity, Fuller studies, geodesic dome, carbon - chemistry, build graphene, diamond, and fullerenes from sticks
- field geometry, construction of predicted fields by hand, measurement and comparison
- manipulation and measurement and depiction of electric fields, van der graaf generators, triboelectricity, electroscopes, electrostatic motors
- magnetic field focus, construct fields and measure and depict them, predict and repeat in real time, build up field art
- harmonic oscillators in phase space: always with fluctuations always with dissipation always with nonlinearity, always with vibrating rocks hanging from sticks
- geometry of two dimensional wave equation solutions: rocks and rubber bands
- geometry of music: relation of notes and harmonics, going between ancient musicology and modern, build and use instruments based on geometry with electrical pickup and amplification
- vortex geometry: pour a fluid into one side of a hand built plastic circuit and observe flow.  create visualization tools where the water is directly imaged, predict behavior geometrically ( a quick check on google scholar shows hundreds of results for vortex geometry before 1900, that’s the place to look before the number worshippers took over, tons of great work was done then, much better than modern fluid bullshit) https://books.google.com/books?amazing book!!!!
- more vortex geometry in air specifically, study flight as a dynamics of vortices, qualitatively
- geometry of quantum tunneling, graphical solutions of schroedinger equation, connected with shot noise measurements using a tool that makes music from the quantum tunneling through the native oxide of beer cans in mud puddles
- geometry of atomic theory connected with optical spectroscopy in trash, this is THE atomic theory we will use.  If you can’t measure it you don’t need it, and if you can, you can make it into geometric art
- geometry of logs and exponents, spirals, decay and growth, relation to biological systems, observe and measure and depict growth and death curves in many systems
geometry of value, build out geometric structures that are made of human values in terms of how we relate to each other as well as how we relate to resources
- differential geometry of constant potential surfaces
- differential geometry of minimal surfaces, use in construction etc. applications to life: cell membranes
- geometry studied with optics, construction and measurement of lenses by hand, creating optical art that depicts the light lines thru the lenses
- geometry of ripples of water. Built it, measure it, depict it and USE it to drive chemical reactions
- geometry of heat equation, study of temperature flow through rocks suspended over a fire.  The study of the heat equation should involve hand carving stone to different shapes, suspending at different heights over a flame, and observing the shape of temperature in and around the object. this can be united with fluid flow studies, observing how air moves around the stone and flame.
- geometry of heat equation II: larger scale, build and study and rebuild dwelling spaces and measure heat flow, study, repeat, build up a applied geometry that optimizes heat flow in human dwelling structures
- geometry of ion flow in a fluid measured with the musical electrochemical probe
- geometry of technological reproduction: do experiments in the propagation of technical artifacts, graph it, make more, adjust the technology to build geometry that works well, overlap and contrast with capitalist “supply chains”
- geometry of geography, how to project and construct maps of ALL kinds by hand, and reproduce and store them
- geometry of data: store data in different physical forms and retrieve it, in artistic way, investigate: stone, wood, plastic, metal, sand, dirt, many sizes and shapes and densities
- geometric investigation of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamics, applications to the planets, Kepler’s laws, etc
- geometry of capitalist bullshit: how to echo the existing design ethos using geometry without copying them, just make neat stuff
