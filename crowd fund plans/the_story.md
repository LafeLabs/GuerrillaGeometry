## The Story

1. 1990s nanotech promised a future of total abundance yet warned of a future of total destruction, neither happened. visuals: pan across classic 90s works of fiction and non fiction. I worked on nanotech for 20 years, started companies[flash logos and products on screen], worked in gov't[flash logo and squids], got phd[flash of actual degree], worked at top nanotech labs[flash of logos UCB, yale, NIST, IBM,APL], got fed up with capitalism, wrote a manifesto in alaska, and now i make strange art and technology from trash , quick flash of image
2. it was all based on capitalism and the Turing machine industry, which is all Monotheism, patriarchy, Holy Trinity, authoritarianism, number worship(money), mining, military, etc. The failure of 90s nanotech was not technology, it was politics and philosophy.  visual: gears, piles of trash, microprocessor architecture, figure from manifesto of evil capitalist God, footage of industrial buildings, images of corporate logos of crappy tech companies
3. we need new models that shift the philosophy of industrial production, which should be about creating feedback loops that connect the human mind, human body, physical world, living world, and other humans. visual: map colored in showing how these things relate   
4. To make these models of freedom and abundance we need to build geometric structures of value and things, and make things replicate using humans, animals and the energy and things around us.  We must directly convert trash into useful things, in a way we can easily teach to others that they will enjoy working on. visual:  self replication montage 
5. The goals are food, medicine, shelter, heating and cooling, materials, transport, communication, and a good life, and some of the machines that will be built are:motors, coolers, heaters, movers of things, storers of things, machines for making things, etc. visual: montage of useful machines flashing through fast with quick words of identity
6. It all starts with self replicating geometric art.  This can be a building block for the rest of it.  To build a world without money and without capitalism I cannot sell this work or put it anywhere in the property system.  And yet I need federal reserve debt currency to survive physically in the existing system while I work on this.  So I'm asking for donations as well as money to deploy this technology to spread whatever your brand or idea or art or technology is using the power of self-replication.  I can do crowd funded custom public deployments, classes, events, and branded custom deployments for companies, schools, government agencies, non profits and religious institutions.  Some of the details are listed below, and there are links to the existing installations and information on future potential ones.  visuals: examples of deployments both real and imagined, corporate custom stuff referenced, description of awards with visuals to back it up, description of what I"ll do regardless


## Awards


#### Core awards will be free to everyone: ebooks, videos, public installations

buying physical books without an installation happens directly from Lulu and Amazon with me not ever ordering books or taking money for them other than a cut of the proceeds, these can be sold over cost by about 2x as is typical for these things, but ebooks always free to download in all formats.

#### offered awards are 
 - fractions of an installation in a public place: 10,25,100 dollar contributions to make total of 2k/installation on East Coast, 5k off East Coast, 10k outside US
 - installation in coffee shop(100 bucks local DC, 200 bucks commuter rail from DC, 500 bucks Acela, 2000 bucks off east coast)
 - installation in school(25 bucks)
 - installation in religious facility(50 bucks)
 - custom branded installation at corporate campus(50,000 bucks minimum)
 - custom branded installation in a chain store(ask for quote)
 
 
## Impact

Self replicating art is the substrate on which self replicating technology can be built, for a free world. I want to build a movement that is the opposite of terrorism.  In terrorism, violence is used to enforce one political or religious ideology, independent of technology and art.  I want to create things that freely replicate and produce based on a union of technology art and life, totally independent of ideology, politics and religion, based on a non-authoritarian architecture.  Geometry is universal.  It is in all religions, all engineering, all art, all design, all social structures, all geography, etc.  So to build self replicating geometric art that does useful things is the pure polar opposite of terrorism.
