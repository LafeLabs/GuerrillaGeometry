## The Story

1. 1990s nanotech promised a future of total abundance yet warned of a future of total destruction, neither happened. visuals: pan across classic 90s works of fiction and non fiction. 
2. it was all based on capitalism and the Turing machine industry, which is all Monotheism, patriarchy, Holy Trinity, authoritarianism, number worship(money), mining, military, etc. The failure of 90s nanotech was not technology, it was politics and philosophy.  visual: gears, piles of trash, microprocessor architecture, figure from manifesto of evil capitalist God, footage of industrial buildings, images of corporate logos of crappy tech companies
3. we need new models that shift the philosophy of industrial production, which should be about creating feedback loops that connect the human mind, human body, physical world, living world, and other humans. visual: map colored in showing how these things relate  The goals are food, medicine, shelter, heating and cooling, materials, transport, communication, and a good life, and some of the machines that will be built are:motors, coolers, heaters, movers of things, storers of things, machines for making things, etc. visual: montage of useful machines flashing through fast with quick words of identity
4. To make these models of freedom and abundance we need to build geometric structures of value and things, and make things replicate using humans, animals and the energy and things around us.  We must directly convert trash into useful things, in a way we can easily teach to others that they will enjoy working on. visual:  self replication montage, trash montage, geometry montage 
5. So the solution to the riddle of both 90s nanotech prophecies and the anarchist dream of worker owned means of production all starts with self replicating geometric art built from trash!  This can be a building block for the rest of it, a substrate on which all future industrial production systems can be built.  
6. [the ask]To build a world without money and without capitalism I cannot sell this work or put it anywhere in the property system.  And yet I need federal reserve debt currency to survive physically in the existing system while I work on this.  So I'm asking for donations as well as money to deploy this technology to spread whatever your brand or idea or art or technology is using the power of self-replication.  I can do crowd funded custom public deployments, classes, events, and branded custom deployments for companies, schools, government agencies, non profits and religious institutions.  Some of the details are listed below, and there are links to the existing installations and information on future potential ones.  visuals: examples of deployments both real and imagined, corporate custom stuff referenced, description of awards with visuals to back it up, description of what I"ll do regardless


## Awards


#### Core awards will be free to everyone: ebooks, videos, public installations

buying physical books without an installation happens directly from Lulu and Amazon with me not ever ordering books or taking money for them other than a cut of the proceeds, these can be sold over cost by about 2x as is typical for these things, but ebooks always free to download in all formats.

#### offered awards are 
 - fractions of an installation in a public place: 10,25,100 dollar contributions to make total of 2k/installation on East Coast, 5k off East Coast, 10k outside US
 - installation in coffee shop(100 bucks local DC, 200 bucks commuter rail from DC, 500 bucks Acela, 2000 bucks off east coast)
 - installation in school(25 bucks)
 - installation in religious facility(50 bucks)
 - custom branded installation at corporate campus(50,000 bucks minimum)
 - custom branded installation in a chain store(ask for quote)
 - monthly class at specified location, open to all comers there(house, park, office park, school etc.)
 
 
 
## Impact

Self replicating geometric art is the substrate on which self replicating technology can be built, for a free world. I want to build a movement that is the opposite of terrorism.  In terrorism, violence is used to enforce one political or religious ideology, independent of technology and art.  I want to create things that freely replicate and produce based on a union of technology art and life, totally independent of ideology, politics and religion, based on a non-authoritarian architecture.  Geometry is universal.  It is in all religions, all engineering, all art, all design, all social structures, all geography, etc.  So to build self replicating geometric art that does useful things is the pure polar opposite of terrorism.

## milestones and targets

 - 10,25,50,100 daily demos
 - another 10,25,50 instructibles
 - tablet and phone app for octal codes deployed and being used for self documentation
 - tablet and phone app adds words-on-pictures format files which are accessed using shape codes
 - augmented reality, networked with other app users
 - same but on a trash magic platform instead of capitalist rectangle(10 years from now)
 - self replicating artBox deployed
 - action geometry e-book with/without documentation of deploying all parts as self replication
 - action geometry with/without physical book(in both cases do the version that simply describes what to do first, then the documented feedback loop which incorporates deploying the things with the book describing that.)
 - deploy motor, self replicating among user/makers
 - deploy EC probe, same, both are intended to actually show trash magic system of value working, with tales and lore embedded in the things, which are all built for free, and gain value and quality as they spread, which they do virally without centralized infrastructure or even documentation
 
 If this works, I will no longer need funding after this stage because I will be able to use my role as a maker/user in the network of other maker/users of the core set of artBox, motor and EC Probe, and those value geometries should have the capacity to support me and others not just in terms of fed debt currency to survive capitalism but values outside capitalism and an ability to actually survive as other key elements of a technological complete set are created and spread by others who join in the value geometries.  I think a goal of starting this transition in 2020 or so is reasonable.
